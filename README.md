## Checkout the finished product:

- run `npm install` in the terminal
- run 'webpack -w' in the terminal
- open `index.html` in the browser

## Lets get coding:

### 1.
Run <code>npm init -y</code> in the terminal to produce the `package.json` file, the `-y` option will create the `package.json` file with the default settings and will not prompt you to answer each question.

### 2.
Create an `index.html` file and a `webpack.config.js` file. A configuration file in Webpack is basically a common.js module. The config file is a place to put all of your configuration, loaders, and other specific information relating to your build.
